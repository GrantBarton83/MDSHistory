<img class="floatright" src="images/historyblackwhite.jpg" alt="Soldier with Dog"/>Dogs in war date back to the 18th century BC and have loyally served Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Sarmatians, Alans, Slavs, Britons, and Native Americans. 
The Roman Empire sent entire formations of attack dogs, frequently equipped with armour or spiked collars, into battle.  War dogs have routed and killed invaders, pulled sleds and telephone cables, delivered supplies to and comforted wounded, detected explosives, and served as guards, messengers, carriers, mascots, and on patrols.  
</p>
<p>
WWI saw the first large-scale use of war dogs in military history. Red Cross Casualty Dogs, also known as Mercy Dogs, were equipped with saddlebags of medical supplies, sought out the wounded, and gave comfort to the dying.  Terriers helped to keep the rat infested muddy trenches clear, and small, YMCA- sponsored, Cigarette Dogs delivered cigarette cartons to troops on the front lines.

Sentinel dogs in the front trenches saved the most human life as they gave soldiers advance warning of approaching patrols, preventing the enemy from getting close enough to use hand grenades. Messenger dogs, considered by some as the real heros of war, were credited with saving thousands of livevs by delivering vital dispatches when phone lines broke down, in between units at the front and headquarters behind. Dogs were ideal for this type of work, as they could run faster than a man and they presented a smaller target. The brave WW I messenger dog has a difficult mission; not only did it have to travel great distances, often under fire, it had to ivercome hundreds of obstacles, including rivers, barbed wire fence, slit trenches, shell holes and chemical gases. 
</p>
<p>
In a March 1918 battle, an infantry company was attacked by a large German force and almost surrounded with a triple barrage fire preventing retreat.  The commander had dispatched three runners in succession to alert headquarters, but all were killed.  He then sent Patsou, a French messenger dog, who ran through a withering barrage, covering 3,000 meters in ten minutes, to deliver the message calling for immediate help.  Reinforcements were sent up in time to save 48 men, all which remained of Patsou's entire company.

Soldiers of both sides adopted many dogs as mascots.  By their courage, loyalty and everlasting good nature, they helped to relieve the feverish strains of war, and to keep up the morale of men in the trenches as it seemed nothing else could do.

The Melrose Dog Park's location adjacent to The Knoll World War I memorial has inspired us to honor the many ways dogs have valiantly saved the lives our U.S. soldiers and helped win our freedom.
